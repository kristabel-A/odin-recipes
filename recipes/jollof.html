        <p>Jollof rice is a dish with deep roots in West African culture, and it's one that carries with it a sense of community, celebration, and tradition. 
            Today we would be learning how to make this delicacy. </p>
            <h2> Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>For the base:</h3>    
            <ul> 
               <li>1 large red bell pepper, cut into small pieces</li> 
               <li>2 medium vine tomatoes, cut into small pieces</li> 
               <li>1 red onion, quartered</li> 
               <li>2 red scotch bonnet chillies, quartered</li> 
               <li>3 garlic cloves, smashed</li> 
               <li>25g fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</li> 
               <li>100ml water</li> 
            </ul> 

            <h3>For the rice: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>150ml vegetable oil</li> 
                <li>1 red onion, finely chopped</li> 
                <li>150g double concentrated tomato purée (we use DeRica)</li> 
                <li>1 tbsp curry powder</li> 
                <li>2 tsp dried thyme</li> 
                <li>3 chicken stock cubes</li> 
                <li>2 dried bay leaves</li> 
                <li>600ml water</li> 
                <li>600g white basmati rice</li> 
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the base ingredients in a blender and blitz until smooth.</li> 
                <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven set over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, then add the tomato purée and cook, stirring frequently, until it begins to darken, 3 to 5 minutes.</li> 
                <li>Pour in the blended base, stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and partially cover the pot with the lid – it will splatter! Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced by about a third of its original volume and the oil begins to separate from the sauce, 12 to 15 minutes.</li> 
                <li>Stir in the curry powder, thyme, stock cubes, bay leaves and water. Season generously with salt and pepper, to taste, then cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li> 
                <li>Meanwhile, rinse the rice thoroughly with cold water until the water runs clean, then drain. Add the rice to the sauce and stir to combine. As soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and cook for 25 minutes.</li> 
                <li>By this point, the rice should have absorbed all the liquid and be cooked through. Remove the bay leaves, give the rice a stir and you’re ready to serve, preferably with grilled chicken and fried plantain.</li> 
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Notes</strong> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>For a milder jollof, use 1 scotch bonnet. If you’re a bona fide spice king/queen, feel free to use 3 or 4.</li> <br>
                <li>Jollof rice is a little tricky to master. After the 25 minutes of cooking time, if the rice is sauce-logged, take the lid off the pot to cook off any excess moisture. If the rice is dry and/or undercooked, stir in 100 ml to 200 ml water, cover and continue to steam over low heat.</li>
            </ul>
